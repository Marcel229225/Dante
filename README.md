This project consists of implementing two algorithms in C. The first is a map generation algorithm and the second an algorithm capable of finding the shortest path to exit this map.

You must have 2 folders : solver with a binary named “solver” in it, generator with binary named “generator”
in it.

It was produced in collaboration with @heritier.daga who took care of generating the map.
